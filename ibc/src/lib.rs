//! This library re-exports implementations of all the Inter-Blockchain
//! Communication (IBC) specifications available in [`ibc-rs`][ibc-rs]
//! repository. IBC is a distributed protocol that enables communication between
//! distinct sovereign blockchains.
//!
//! The layout of this crate mirrors the organization of the [IBC
//! Standard][ibc-standard]:
//!
//! + [Core](core) implements the transport, authentication, and ordering layers
//!   of the IBC protocol.
//!
//! + [Clients](clients) consists of implementations of client verification
//! algorithms (following the base client interface that is defined in `Core`)
//! for specific consensus algorithms. A chain uses these verification
//! algorithms to verify the state of remote chains.
//!
//! + [Applications](apps) consists of implementations of some IBC applications.
//! This is the part of the protocol that abstracts away the core protocol and
//! focuses solely on business logic.
