//! Contains types and implementations that are needed to integrate a light
//! client, built using ibc-rs, into a CosmWasm contract. This crate functions as
//! a library, allowing users to import the ready-made `Context` object that is
//! generic across light clients, introduce their concrete client type and
//! integrate their assembled context into the CosmWasm contract's entrypoint.
//! NOTE: To utilize the CosmWasm contract developed using this library, hosting
//! environments must support the CosmWasm module and be using one of the versions of
//! `ibc-go` that supports the `08-wasm` proxy light client.
