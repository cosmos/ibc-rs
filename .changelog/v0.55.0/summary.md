This release brings major improvements to error handling in `ibc-rs`, giving
hosting environments better control over errors and easier debugging for the
developers. A key enhancement is the clearer distinction between host-sourced
errors and those propagated by `ibc-rs`, effectively separating host-level
errors from protocol-level ones. Therefore, a noticeable update is the renaming
of the previous `ContextError` to `HandlerError`, which now exclusively manages
errors from IBC handlers. In parallel, a new `HostError` has been introduced to
handle errors originating from hosts, particularly those from validation and
execution contexts. Additionally, error definitions within `ibc-rs` have been
unified, reducing the granularity of error variants. For more details, please
refer to [ADR-011](./docs/architecture/adr-11-refactor-errors.md).

In addition, it introduces various fixes and enhancements. Notably, helper
traits with default implementations have been added to simplify the conversion
between host time types and `Timestamp`. Consequently, the `ibc-primitives`
crate has been fully decoupled from the `tendermint` dependency.

Itâ€™s also worth noting that the `cosmwasm` workspace has been relocated to its
own repository, now available under
[cosmwasm-ibc](https://github.com/informalsystems/cosmwasm-ibc).

There are no consensus-breaking changes in this release.
