# CHANGELOG

## v0.54.0

*August 12, 2024*

This release includes a number of breaking changes, including separating the
packet timeout timestamp from the host `Timestamp` via defining a new bespoke
`TimeoutTimestamp` type. The `cosmwasm` feature flag has been removed. CosmWasm
implementations have also been migrated into their own separate workspace under
the `cosmwasm` directory in an effort to simplify dependency management.

Notable bug fixes include:

- Correctly preventing expired client creation
- Expiring clients when the elapsed time from a trusted header matches the
  trusting period
- Allowing user-defined upgrade paths for client upgrades rather than just
  defaulting to `UPGRADED_IBC_STATE`
- Preventing `Timestamp::nanoseconds` from panicking by disallowing negative
  values from `tendermint::Time`

Lastly, this release adds some new features, including allowing proof
verification methods to accept custom paths, thus allowing light client
developers to introduce custom path serialization logic into their applications.
CosmWasm response types have been refactored to match the `08-wasm` client API.

This release bumps the MSRV of ibc-rs to 1.72.1. `prost` has been bumped to 0.13.1.
`ibc-proto` has been bumped to 0.47.0. `tendermint` dependencies have been bumped
to 0.38.0. The `cosmwasm` dependency has also been bumped to 2.1.0.

## v0.53.0

*May 13, 2024*

This release overhauls the `ibc-testkit` crate such that it is now able to:

- simulate more realistic IBC workflows by utilizing real IBC and relayer
  interfaces (as opposed to mocked versions)
- validate code paths that were not easily testable beforehand, such as Merkle
  proof generation
- compose tests in a much more succinct and readable fashion

Note that the drastic changes made to `ibc-testkit`'s structs and types are
breaking changes.

For more information and background context on the changes to `ibc-testkit` and
the rationale behind the overhaul, please refer to [ADR 009][adr-009].

This release also includes two fixes. One is to reject packets without height
and timestamp timeout. The other is to correct the proof verification logic for
a `PacketTimeout` due to a closed channel, which was verifying an incorrect
field. It also bumps the minimum-supported version of `ibc-proto` to 0.44, and
the version of `tendermint` to 0.36. Note that the minimum-supported Rust
version was reverted back to 1.71.1.

[adr-009]: https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-009-revamp-testkit.md

  eliminate manual delegations by utilizing monomorphization.
  ([\#1044](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/1044))
- [ibc-testkit] Major refactor of the `ibc-testkit` via
  [ADR-09](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-009-revamp-testkit.md).
  ([\#1109](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/1109))

## v0.52.0

*April 26, 2024*

This release adds some exciting changes, improvements, and new features to ibc-rs.
First and foremost, support for the IBC protocol's [client recovery][client-recovery]
mechanism has been implemented, which provides a route for frozen and expired IBC clients
to be re-instated following a successful governance vote. In addition, a new crate,
`ibc-client-cw`, facilitates CosmWasm contract creation for light clients built using
`ibc-rs`. Lastly, the ics07 tendermint light client has also been packaged and included
as a CosmWasm contract.

This release also includes a myriad of other bug-fixes and improvements,
such as enhancing the portability of ibc-rs's Validation and Execution Context traits,
as well as fixing an incompatibility with how ibc-rs parses `PrefixDenom`s compared
to ibc-go, among many others.

The minimum-supported Rust version has been updated to `1.72`. `ibc-proto` has been
bumped to `0.43`. `tendermint` has been bumped to `0.35`. `ibc-derive` has been
bumped to `0.7`.

There are no consensus-breaking changes as part of this release.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [ibc] Enhance portability of custom `Validation/ExecutionContext` traits under
  ICS-07. They are relocated, along with the rest of the
  client-relevant context APIs, under ICS-02, with the traits renamed to

  self-description ([\#1163](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/1163))
- [ibc-client-tendermint] Simplify custom verifiers usage for Tendermint
  clients by directly binding with `tendermint_light_client_verifier::Verifier`
  and removing the unused `TmVerifier` trait.
  ([\#1168](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/pull/1168))

  ([\#1145](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/pull/1145))
- [ibc-client-tendermint] Decouple the arguments of ICS07 Header/Misbehavior
  verification functions from the Tendermint client type by flattening and
  passing only the required fields.

  ([\#1171](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/1171))

## v0.51.0

*March 26, 2024*

This release introduces a few changes for better customizability. The main one is modularizing ICS-24, ICS-02, and ICS-07 trait implementations. This change empowers developers to write Rust light clients succinctly in a smart-contract context like CosmWasm. Also, the default Tendermint client state verifier is now detached to support custom verifiers, if required.

In addition, this version fixes a bug where the consensus state is incorrectly stored when a header with an older height is submitted.

Furthermore, a set of new host keys is added. This makes `ibc-rs` more consistent with the storage access of `ibc-go`. Also, access to client update information is merged into a single method; instead of individual details.

This release updates the `ibc-proto-rs` dependency to `v0.42.2`. This takes account of the updated `MsgUpdateClient` and deprecates `MsgSubmitMisbehaviour`. Also, `ibc-derive` dependency is updated to `v0.6.1`.
Finally, the minimum supported Rust version is corrected and updated to `1.71.1`.

There are no consensus-breaking changes.

### BREAKING CHANGES

  ([\#1123](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/1123))

## v0.50.0

*January 24, 2024*

This release introduces several noteworthy libraries. A standout addition is the
implementation of the ICS-721 NFT transfer application, enabling the transfer of
NFT packets across chains that support this capability.

In addition, It incorporates the ICS-08 Wasm light client data structure and
types. This empowers light client developers to create CosmWasm contracts for
deployment on Cosmos chains compatible with the version of `ibc-go` supporting
ICS-08 Wasm client.

Furthermore, this release addresses the issue with the macro derivation of the
`ClientState` when contexts include generic types, exposes additional convenient
types and serializers through `ibc-primitives` and includes a more flexible
constructor for `MockContext` types within the `ibc-testkit` crate, allowing to
write tests with diverse parameter combinations.

There are no consensus-breaking changes.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [ibc] Bump `ibc-proto-rs` to v0.41.0
  ([\#1036](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/pull/1036)).

### BUG FIXES

  generic types. ([\#910](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/910))
- [ibc-derive] Adapt macro derivations to integrate with projects dependent on
  `ibc-core` ([\#999](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/999)).

### FEATURES

  ([\#346](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/346))
- [ibc-client-wasm-types] Implement ICS-08 Wasm light client domain types
  ([\#1030](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/1030)).

### IMPROVEMENTS

  and `Duration` for added convenience when developing IBC light clients or
  applications. ([\#1054](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/pull/1054))
- [ibc-primitives] Relocate `serializers.rs` module to reside within the
  `ibc-primitives` crate extending its utility for a broader range of IBC
  applications. ([\#1055](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/1055))

## v0.49.1

*January 3, 2024*

This release continues the trend of further decoupling dependencies between the
different ibc-rs sub-crates and modules.

In particular, the `prost` dependency is now only imported in the
`ibc-primitives` crate; note that error variants originating from `prost` have
largely been removed, which is a breaking change. The `bytes` dependency was
also removed. Additionally, `CommitmentProofBytes` can now be accessed without
explicit ownership of the object for which the proof is being queried for.

Some other improvements of note include making the CosmWasm check more rigorous,
streamlining the `Msg` trait and renaming it to `ToProto`, as well as
implementing custom JSON and Borsh `ChainId` deserialization.

There are no consensus-breaking changes.

### BREAKING CHANGES

  `ibc-app-transfer` crate.
  ([\#987](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/987))

## v0.48.0

*November 22, 2023*

In this release, we've undertaken a comprehensive overhaul of the **`ibc-rs`**
repository, resulting in a strategic reorganization of the codebase. This
restructuring dissects the implementation of each IBC specification,
categorizing and situating them within relevant libraries. The primary objective
is to elevate `ibc-rs` practicality and enhance user flexibility by providing a
more modular and composable experience.

Users now have the flexibility to choose from a spectrum of dependencies. They
can opt to utilize the entire suite of meta-crates, such as `ibc`, `ibc-core`,
`ibc-clients`, or `ibc-apps`. Alternatively, they can exercise fine-grained
control by selectively importing specific crates. This can involve bringing in
an entire implemented IBC sub-module, like the `ibc-core-client` crate, or
importing only the associated data structures of a module, such as the
`ibc-core-client-types` crate.

Furthermore, this release introduces optimizations centered around construction
and validation of ICS-24 host identifiers, aiming to curtail some heap
allocations, beneficial for resource-constrained hosts.

There are no consensus-breaking changes.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Move ICS-20 and ICS-27 implementations to the respective part of `ibc-apps`
  and `ibc-clients` crates, as part of the `ibc` crate restructuring effort.

  modular libraries, enabling the selective import of specific domain types or
  module implementations, either individually or in combination, providing
  enhanced flexibility and ease of use.
  ([\#965](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/965))

  ([\#951](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/951))
- Expose domain message types under the `ics04_channel` as public
  ([\#952](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/952))
- Enhance dependency management with workspace inheritance
  ([\#955](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/955))
- Simplify and refactor ICS-24 identifier validation logic.
  ([\#961](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/961))

The goal with this release was to replace `ClientState::{confirm_not_frozen, expired}()` with `ClientState::status()` ([#536](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/issues/536)). Updating basecoin-rs with the new changes exposed the shortcomings of having `SendPacket*Context` be supertraits of `TokenTransfer*Context`, which in turned exposed the shortcomings of having `Router` be a supertrait of `ValidationContext`. Hence, we decoupled everything!

There are consensus-breaking changes.

## v0.40.0

*May 8, 2023*

This release primarily consolidated the modules in the ibc-rs crate, removed many legacy items, and documented every item in the crate. This represents a big step towards v1.0. Very few items changed name; most were just moved to elsewhere in the module tree. Perhaps a good heuristic to fix the breaking changes is the remove the faulty `use` statements, and have your editor re-import the item.

There were also a few minor validation checks missing, which we added. These were pretty much the last remaining known ones.

There are consensus-breaking changes.

### BREAKING CHANGES

Includes:

- Client state, consensus state, connection, channel queries.
    - Note: deserialization is unimplemented as it has dependency on migration to protobuf for ABCI queries
- IBC Modules partial implementation for datastructures, messages and queries.
- Some English and TLA+ specifications for Connection & Channel Handshake as well as naive relayer algorithm.
