## Releases

Our release process is as follows:

1. In a new branch `release/vX.Y.Z`, update the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) to
   reflect and summarize all changes in the release. This involves:
   1. Running `unclog build -u` and copy pasting the output at the top of the
      `CHANGELOG.md` file, making sure to update the header with the new
      version.
   2. Running `unclog release --editor <editor> vX.Y.Z` to create a summary of
      all of the changes in this release.
      1. Your text editor will open. Write the release summary, and close the
         editor. Make sure to include a comment on whether or not the release
         contains consensus-breaking changes.
      2. Add this same summary to `CHANGELOG.md` as well.
   3. Committing the updated `CHANGELOG.md` file and `.changelog` directory to
      the repo.
2. Push this to a branch `release/vX.Y.Z` according to the version number of the
   anticipated release (e.g. `release/v0.18.0`) and open a **draft PR**.
3. If there were changes in the `ibc-derive` crate, we need to publish a new
   version of that crate.
   1. bump the version in `crates/ibc-derive/Cargo.toml`
   2. Publish `ibc-derive` with `cargo publish -p ibc-derive`
4. Bump the versions of all crates to the new version in their Cargo.toml and in
   the root `Cargo.toml` as well, and push these changes to the release PR.
   - If you released a new version of `ibc-derive` in step 3, make sure to
     update that dependency.
   - Verify that there is no dev-dependency among the workspace crates. This is
     important, as `cargo-release` ignores dev-dependency edges. You may use
     `cargo-depgraph`:
     ```sh
     cargo depgraph --all-features --workspace-only --dev-deps | dot -Tpng > graph.png
     ```
     The command will generate a graph similar to this:
     ![alt test](docs/dev-deps-graph.png) The dev dependencies are colored with
     blue arrows. Currently, there are no blue arrows, i.e. there is no dev
     dependency among the IBC crates. It is advised to avoid any dev dependency
     because of release order complicacy (except maybe inside `ibc-testkit`, as
     it is the top crate that depends on `ibc` crate and no other crate depends
     on it).
   - In order to resolve such a situation, the dev dependencies other than
     `ibc-testkit` can be manually released to crates.io first so that the
     subsequent crates that depend on them can then be released via the release
     process. For instructions on how to release a crate on crates.io, refer
     [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html).
5. Beware of [crates-io rate limit][cargo-release-rate-limit]. It is 5 for
   publishing new crates and 30 for publishing existing crates. But the number
   of our crates has reached 31. So we publish a leaf crate, `ibc-primitives`
   manually and release the rest of the 30 crates via CI.
   - Release `ibc-primitives` by running:
   ```sh
   cargo release -p ibc-primitives --no-push --no-tag --allow-branch main --execute
   ```
   - Validate the number of crates that need to be released via CI, it can not
     be more than 30.
   - There should be a 10 minutes delay between the release of `ibc-primitives`
     and the release of the rest of the crates on CI.
   - If new crates are added, we need to recompute the set of crates that we
     want to release via CI. The rest must be released manually.
6. Run `cargo doc -p ibc --all-features --open` locally to double-check that all
   the documentation compiles and seems up-to-date and coherent. Fix any
   potential issues here and push them to the release PR.
7. Mark the PR as **Ready for Review** and incorporate feedback on the release.
   Once approved, merge the PR.
8. Checkout the `main` and pull it with
   `git checkout main && git pull origin main`.
9. Create a signed tag `git tag -s -a vX.Y.Z`. In the tag message, write the
   version and the link to the corresponding section of the changelog. Then push
   the tag to GitHub with `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
   - The [release workflow][release.yaml] will run the `cargo release --execute`
     command in a CI worker.
10. If some crates have not been released, check the cause of the failure and
    act accordingly:
    1. In case of intermittent problems with the registry, try `cargo release`
       locally to publish any missing crates from this release. This step
       requires the appropriate privileges to push crates to [crates.io].
    2. If there is any new crate published locally, add
       [ibcbot](https://crates.io/users/ibcbot) to its owners list.
    3. In case problems arise from the source files, fix them, bump a new patch
       version (e.g. `v0.48.1`) and repeat the process with its corresponding
       new tag.
11. Once the tag is pushed, wait for the CI bot to create a GitHub release, then
    update the release description and append:
    `[ðŸ“–CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-rs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#vXYZ)`

### Communications (non-technical) release pipeline

- Notify the communications team about the pending release and prepare an
  announcement.
- Coordinate with other organizations that are active in IBC development (e.g.,
  Interchain) and keep them in the loop.

All done! ðŸŽ‰
